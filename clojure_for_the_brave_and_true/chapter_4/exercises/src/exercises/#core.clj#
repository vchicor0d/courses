;; 1. Turn the result of your glitter filter into a list of names.

;; 2. Write a function, append, which will append a new suspect to your list of suspects.

;; 3. Write a function, validate, which will check that :name and :glitter-index are present when you append. The validate function should accept two arguments: a map of keywords to validating functions, similar to conversions, and the record to be validated.

;; 4. Write a function that will take your list of maps and convert it back to a CSV string. Youâ€™ll need to use the clojure.string/join function.
